# Vibe-coding a Multiplayer Game using Multisynq and Three.js

This project demonstrates the concept of vibe-coding, where developers create software in a fluid, intuitive manner, often relying on AI assistance to enhance creativity and productivity. This approach allows for rapid prototyping and iteration, focusing on the overall feel and experience of the application.

## Overview

In this example, we combine Multisynq for multiplayer capabilities and Three.js for 3D rendering to create a single-page game. The original car game, vibe-coded by [mrdoob](https://x.com/mrdoob/status/1904829276530016641), serves as the foundation. This version extends the game to support multiplayer functionality without altering the core gameplay.

## Key Technologies

- **Croquet 2.0 Library**: Utilizes the Multisynq DePIN network for multiplayer synchronization, allowing the "server logic" to run on identical VMs in each client. This ensures all clients remain in sync without explicit state synchronization.

- **Three.js**: Provides the 3D rendering capabilities, enabling the creation of visually engaging environments.

## Multiplayer Synchronization

Multisynq's global decentralized network of "synchronizers" ensures that all VMs in a session process the exact same stream of events simultaneously, maintaining synchronization across clients. Each session is end-to-end encrypted, with session details embedded in the URL for easy sharing.

## Getting Started
