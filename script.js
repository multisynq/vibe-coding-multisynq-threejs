// We use Three.js for 3D graphics and Croquet for multiplayer logic

// Croquet works by splitting the code into model and view:
// * The model is the shared simulation state.
// * The view is the interface between the simulation and the local client.

// The model takes on the role of server code in traditional multiplayer
// approaches. There is no need to implement any networking code or server-side code.

// Model code execution is synchronized across all clients in the session
// via Multisynq's synchronizer network, which feeds the exact same time
// and sequence of user input events to all clients.
// This ensures that all clients are executing the exact same code at the
// exact same time, so the simulation is deterministic and consistent.
// It also means that no state needs to be transmitted between clients, or
// be sent from the server to the clients. Instead, you can run e.g. physics
// or NPC code in the model, and it will be exactly the same for all clients.

// All constants used in the simulation must be defined as Croquet.Constants
// so that they get hashed into the session ID, ensuring that all clients
// in the same session use the same constants
const C = Croquet.Constants;
C.carSpeed = 0.15;
C.turnSpeed = 0.05;
C.trainSpeed = 0.01;
C.trainRadius = 30;

// Any Croquet app must be split into model and view.
// The model is the shared simulation state.
// The view is the interface between the simulation and the local client.

// The shared simulation model must be entirely self-contained
// and not depend on any state outside of it.
// This is to ensure that all clients have the same simulation state.

// Additionally, all code executed in the model must be identical on all
// clients. Croquet ensures that by hashing the model code into the session ID.
// If the model uses any external code, it must be added to Constants
// to get hashed, too. For external libraries, it's ususally sufficient
// to add their version number to Constants so if two clients have different
// versions of the same library, they will be in different sessions.
